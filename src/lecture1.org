** Uncertainty in Engineering
Would we get identical answers if...
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
- each of us measured the height of the classroom's wall?
- we measured the classroom's air temperature?
- we had to calculate the width of a room knowing the height and that the room
  measures 8' x 6' x 3'?

/*Uncertainties are unavoidable, but as engineers we need to account for them!*/
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Uncertainty affects both design and operations.
- Probability and Statistics provide the tools for its modeling and analysis.
- Directly translatable to risk.
